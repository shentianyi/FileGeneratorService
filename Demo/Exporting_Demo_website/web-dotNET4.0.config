<configuration>

  <!-- THIS WEB.CONFIG IS FOR .NET VERSION 4.0 (and later) -->

  <!--
  This configures the HttpHandler option (HighchartsExport.axd). With this
  option you can delete the HighchartsExport.aspx page. This section is not 
  required if you prefer the .aspx page and don't want to use the HttpHandler.
  
  You can specify any name for the handler in path="..."  

  ASP.NET HttpHandler option:
  
  Advantages:
  - No page (.aspx) file needed.
  - An HttpHandler exists in all site subdirectories and child web applications 
    so there is no need to send an explicit URL path to Highcharts JS.
    
    NOTE for .NET version 4.0:
    The entire web site must use requestValidationMode="2.0" in order for
    the handler to work in every subdirectory. Alternatively, request
    validation can be specified for only one (or more) specific paths by
    using the <location> element (see below).
  -->
  <system.web>
    <httpHandlers>
      <add verb="POST" 
           path="HighchartsExport.axd"
           type="Tek4.Highcharts.Exporting.HttpHandler, Tek4.Highcharts.Exporting"/>
    </httpHandlers>
    
    <!--
    This allows HttpHandler to work in every subdirectory. This changes
    request validation for your entire web site. If you only want to allow
    version 2.0 request validation for the HighchartsExport.axd HttpHandler,
    delete this and use the <location path="..."> configuration section below.
     -->
    <httpRuntime requestValidationMode="2.0"/>
  </system.web>

  <!-- 
  This section is needed if your web site does not specify version 2.0
  request validation. Specify the path where you want to allow the HttpHandler
  to work. The path is relative to the web.config file directory and must 
  not start with '/'.
  
  Examples:
    path="HighchartsExport.axd"
    path="Export/HighchartsExport.axd"
    
  You can specify any name for the handler, but it must match the name
  specified in the <httpHandlers> section above.
  -->
  <location path="HighchartsExport.axd">
    <system.web>
      <httpRuntime requestValidationMode="2.0"/>
    </system.web>
  </location>

  <!--
  This section is needed for .NET 4.0 (and later) if you want to use the
  HighchartsExport.aspx page to handle chart export requests.

  You can rename the .aspx file to anything you want and place it in any
  sub-directory, but the name and path below must match.
  
  If you choose to use the HttpHandler option, then you may delete this
  configuration section along with the HighchartsExport.aspx file.
  -->
  <location path="HighchartsExport.aspx">
    <system.web>
      <httpRuntime requestValidationMode="2.0"/>
    </system.web>
  </location>

</configuration>
