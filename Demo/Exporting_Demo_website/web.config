	<!--
  This configures the HttpHandler option (HighchartsExport.axd). With this
  option you can delete the HighchartsExport.aspx page. This section is not 
  required if you prefer the .aspx page and don't want to use the HttpHandler.
  
  You can specify any name for the handler in path="..."
  
  Advantages:
  - No page (.aspx) file needed.
  - An HttpHandler exists in all site subdirectories and child web applications 
    so there is no need to send an explicit URL path to Highcharts JS.
