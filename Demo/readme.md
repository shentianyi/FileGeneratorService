## Tek4.Highcharts.Exporting assembly

Tek4 ASP.NET Exporting Module for Highcharts JS (http://highcharts.com/).
Version 1.0.2.0 (March 3, 2012)

* Based upon ASP.NET Highcharts export module by Cl√©ment Agarini (June 15, 2011).
* Re-written by Kevin P. Rice (http://tek4.com/).
* Utilizes customized Svg.dll provided by OlgaD (https://github.com/imclem/Highcharts-export-module-asp.net/issues/1).


## Quick start

### Demo web site ###
* Visual Studio: Open the solution (.sln) and run the demo website.
* IIS: Create a web application and copy the files in the demo website directory (choosing correct web.config).

### Your web site ###
* Copy the three .dll files from the demo website /bin directory to your website /bin directory (Tek4.Highcharts.Exporting.dll, itextsharp.dll, Svg.dll).
* Review the demo website 'Default.aspx' and 'web.config' files for configuration and usage details.
* Configuration in 'web.config' is for .NET 3.5 and 'web-dotNET4.0.config' is for .NET 4.0 and later.
